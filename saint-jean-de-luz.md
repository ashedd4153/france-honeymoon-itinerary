## 💰 Cost Comparison: vs. San Sebastián
Is it cheaper? **Yes.**
*   **Average Hotel:** Saint-Jean-de-Luz is generally **cheaper** than San Sebastián in high season. You get more space for your money here.
*   **Food:** French prices (bistros €40-60/pp) vs. cheap Spanish pintxos (€20-30/pp). So typically, **sleeping is cheaper here, eating is cheaper in Spain.**

## 🥾 Hiking & Activities (The "Active" Side)
*Yes, the hiking here is spectacular.*

### 1. The Coastal Walk (Easy Version)
*   **The Route:** Walk from the port to **Fort Socoa** (~45 mins flat walk along the bay).
*   **Why:** You get the sea views and the historic fort without the cliffs/mud.
*   **Difficulty:** Very Easy / Flat.

### 2. The Mountain: La Rhune (Zero Effort Version)
*   **The Experience:** 360° views of France and Spain from 900m up.
*   **How:** **Train UP, Train DOWN.** No hiking required. Just walk around the summit for the views and coffee. Ticket info: **[Train de la Rhune Official Site](https://www.rhune.com/en/)**.
*   **Difficulty:** Zero (Sit & Enjoy).

### 3. The Coastal Hike: Sentier du Littoral (Moderate)
*   **The Route:** Cliff-top path to Hendaye.
*   **Difficulty:** Moderate (undulating terrain). Only do this if you *want* a workout.

### 3. Culture & Sightseeing
*   **Royal History:** Visit the **Église Saint-Jean-Baptiste** (spectacular Basque baroque interior) where Louis XIV married Maria Theresa.
*   **The Square:** Place Louis XIV is the heartbeat of town—perfect for people-watching.

## 🍽 Foodie Guide (The "Tasty" Side)
*Basque cuisine is legendary here. It's less "tapas", more "seafood & spice".*

### Top Picks
*   **[L'Essentiel](https://www.lessentiel-saint-jean-de-luz.fr/):** (Michelin Recommended) Modern, market-driven bistro. Authentic and fresh.
*   **[Le Kaïku](http://www.kaiku.fr/):** (Michelin Recommended) High-end seafood in a gorgeous setting. Oldest house in town?
*   **[Chez Pablo](https://restaurant-chez-pablo.com/):** (Casual) The classic, rowdy spot for *chipirons* (squid) and cider.

### Must-Eats
*   **Macarons:** Go to **[Maison Adam](https://www.maisonadam.fr/)** (since 1660). They are chewy, almondy, and nothing like the colorful Parisian ones.
*   **Gâteau Basque:** Try it with black cherry filling (*cerise noire*).
*   **Seafood:** *Ttoro* (Basque fish stew) is the local specialty.

## 🧳 Notes
- Much quieter than nearby Biarritz
- Perfect 2-night romantic stop before San Sebastián
- Cross into Spain easily (~20 min to San Sebastián)
