# 🌊 Saint-Jean-de-Luz
[← Back to Itinerary](README.md)

## 🗓 July 24–26

## 🇫🇷 Choosing Your Coastal Base (Days 5-7)
*You asked: "Is this the right place?"*

### Option A: Saint-Jean-de-Luz (Recommended)
*   **Best for:** Romance, quiet charm, swimming, foodies who want "authentic" Basque life.
*   **Vibe:** A 17th-century royal fishing village. Intimate and walkable.
*   **Activities:** Louis XIV history, eating seafood in the port, swimming in the calm bay.
*   **Why Here?** It feels like a honeymoon. It's slower and prettier.

### Sample 2-Day "Relaxed" Itinerary
*   **Day 1 (Arrival):** Beach sunset and seafood dinner at *Le Kaïku*.
*   **Day 2 (Activity):** Morning: Take the train up **La Rhune** for coffee & views. Afternoon: Flat walk to **Fort Socoa** or just spa time.
*   **Day 3 (Depart):** Early train to Loire Valley.

### Option B: Biarritz (The Alternative)
*   **Best for:** Surfers, glitz, nightlife, grand sightseeing.
*   **Vibe:** "California meets 19th-century Palace." Bigger, flashier, busier.
*   **Activities:** Aquarium, surfing (waves are big), casinos, rooftop drinks.
*   **Verdict:** If you want **action/glamour**, pick Biarritz. If you want **romance/relaxation**, stick with Saint-Jean-de-Luz. (You can visit Biarritz easily by train for a day trip!)

## 🏨 Where to Stay
*Focus: Relaxed, romantic, beach vibes.*

1.  **Grand Hôtel Thalasso & Spa:** (Splurge) The iconic pink building on the beach. Incredible spa. **Price:** $$$$ (~$420+/night)
2.  **Hôtel Parc Victoria:** (Quiet Luxury) A lush garden retreat slightly inland. 5-star. **Price:** $$$ (~$350+/night)
3.  **Boutique Options:** Plenty of smaller 3-4 star hotels near Rue Gambetta. **Price:** $$ (~$150–200/night)

## 💰 Cost Comparison: vs. San Sebastián
Is it cheaper? **Yes.**
*   **Average Hotel:** Saint-Jean-de-Luz is generally **cheaper** than San Sebastián in high season. You get more space for your money here.
*   **Food:** French prices (bistros €40-60/pp) vs. cheap Spanish pintxos (€20-30/pp). So typically, **sleeping is cheaper here, eating is cheaper in Spain.**

## 🥾 Hiking & Activities (The "Active" Side)
*Yes, the hiking here is spectacular.*

### 1. The Coastal Walk (Easy Version)
*   **The Route:** Walk from the port to **Fort Socoa** (~45 mins flat walk along the bay).
*   **Why:** You get the sea views and the historic fort without the cliffs/mud.
*   **Difficulty:** Very Easy / Flat.

### 2. The Mountain: La Rhune (Zero Effort Version)
*   **The Experience:** 360° views of France and Spain from 900m up.
*   **How:** **Train UP, Train DOWN.** No hiking required. Just walk around the summit for the views and coffee.
*   **Difficulty:** Zero (Sit & Enjoy).

### 3. The Coastal Hike: Sentier du Littoral (Moderate)
*   **The Route:** Cliff-top path to Hendaye.
*   **Difficulty:** Moderate (undulating terrain). Only do this if you *want* a workout.

### 3. Culture & Sightseeing
*   **Royal History:** Visit the **Église Saint-Jean-Baptiste** (spectacular Basque baroque interior) where Louis XIV married Maria Theresa.
*   **The Square:** Place Louis XIV is the heartbeat of town—perfect for people-watching.

## 🍽 Foodie Guide (The "Tasty" Side)
*Basque cuisine is legendary here. It's less "tapas", more "seafood & spice".*

### Top Picks
*   **L'Essentiel:** (Michelin Recommended) Modern, market-driven bistro. Authentic and fresh.
*   **Le Kaïku:** (Michelin Recommended) High-end seafood in a gorgeous setting. Oldest house in town?
*   **Chez Pablo:** (Casual) The classic, rowdy spot for *chipirons* (squid) and cider.

### Must-Eats
*   **Macarons:** Go to **Maison Adam** (since 1660). They are chewy, almondy, and nothing like the colorful Parisian ones.
*   **Gâteau Basque:** Try it with black cherry filling (*cerise noire*).
*   **Seafood:** *Ttoro* (Basque fish stew) is the local specialty.

## 🧳 Notes
- Much quieter than nearby Biarritz
- Perfect 2-night romantic stop before San Sebastián
- Cross into Spain easily (~20 min to San Sebastián)
