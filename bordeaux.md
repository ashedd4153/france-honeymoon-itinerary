# Bordeaux Wine Country (Days 1–2)
[← Back to Itinerary](README.md)


## 🚆 Getting There (Day 1)
- **From CDG:** TGV INOUI ~4h direct to Bordeaux Saint-Jean
- **Target arrival:** ~4:00 PM (perfect for vineyard check-in)
- **Pro tip:** The TGV station is integrated into CDG Terminal 2

## 🏨 Where to Stay: Vineyard vs. City

For your first night, you have two distinct options. Since you arrive around 4:00 PM, a vineyard check-in is very doable, but consider the logistics:

### Option A: The Vineyard Stay (Romantic & Immersive)
Stay directly at a Château. This is the "honeymoon dream" but requires a bit more coordination for dinner and transport.
- **Top Picks:**
    - **Les Sources de Caudalie:** (Martillac) The ultimate luxury/spa experience. ~25 min taxi. **Price:** $$$$ ($500–$900+/night)
    - **Château Pape Clément:** (Pessac) Historic estate, very close to city. **Price:** $$$ ($450–$700/night)
    - **Château Hotel Grand Barrail:** (Saint-Émilion) Fairytale castle vibes. **Price:** $$–$$$ ($250–$500/night)
- **Pros:** Total immersion, stunning views, onsite tastings.
- **Cons:** Requires Uber/Taxi for everything; limited dining options if the Château restaurant is closed/full.

### Option B: The City Stay (Convenient & Lively)
Stay in the heart of Bordeaux and visit vineyards the next day.
- **Neighborhood:** Chartrons (The "West Village" of Bordeaux)
- **Top Pick:** **Hôtel de Tourny** – elegant boutique hotel. **Price:** $$ ($180–$300/night)
- **Pros:** Walkable to dozens of restaurants, lively atmosphere, easy "landing" after travel.

## 🍷 Wine Experiences
- **Cité du Vin** – interactive wine museum
- Half-day trip to **Saint-Émilion** (UNESCO village + tastings)
- Wine bar hopping in the city

## 🗺 Activities
- Stroll along the Garonne riverfront
- Miroir d'Eau (water mirror) at Place de la Bourse

## 🍾 White Wine Note
Bordeaux Blancs are excellent – look for **dry whites** from Pessac-Léognan or Entre-Deux-Mers (Sauvignon Blanc blends, similar to Sancerre style).
