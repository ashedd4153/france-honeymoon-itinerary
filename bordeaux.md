## Overview & Logistics

### Why Visit
- **The Vibe:** "Petit Paris" but walkable and obsessed with wine.
- **The Food:** Distinct from Paris (more duck, foie gras, heavy reds).
- **The Logistics:** TGV from Tours drops you right in the center (St Jean).

### Getting There & Away
- **From Loire:** TGV (Direct, ~1h 40m).
- **To San Sebastian:** Train to Hendaye + Euskotren (~3h) OR Rental Car (Recommended for the drive south).

## 🏨 Where to Stay: Vineyard vs. City

For your night here, you have two distinct options. Since you are arriving from the Loire, checking into a city hotel is easiest:

### Option A: The Vineyard Stay (Romantic & Immersive)
Stay directly at a Château. This is the "honeymoon dream" but requires a bit more coordination for dinner and transport.
- **Top Picks:**
    - **[Les Sources de Caudalie](https://www.sources-caudalie.com/en/):** (Martillac) The ultimate luxury/spa experience. ~25 min taxi. **Price:** $$$$ ($500–$900+/night)
    - **[Château Pape Clément](https://www.chateau-pape-clement.fr):** (Pessac) Historic estate, very close to city. **Price:** $$$ ($450–$700/night)
    - **[Château Hôtel Grand Barrail](https://www.grand-barrail.com/):** (Saint-Émilion) Fairytale castle vibes. **Price:** $$$–$$$$ (~$400+/night in July).
- **Pros:** Total immersion, stunning views, onsite tastings/spa.
- **Cons:** Requires Uber/Taxi for everything.

### 🏰 Château Hotel Grand Barrail: The "Need to Know"
Since this is your top choice, here is how to make it perfect:
- **Dining:** The on-site restaurant is excellent but **extremely popular**.
    - **Action:** Book your table *at the same time* you book your room. Do not wait.
    - **Backup:** If full, ask the concierge to book you a table in Saint-Émilion village (~5 min taxi).
- **Activities:**
    - **Spa:** Features a jacuzzi facing the vines. Book treatments in advance.
    - **Bikes:** Rent electric bikes on-site (~€40/day) to ride through the vineyards to Pomerol or Saint-Émilion.
    - **Tasting:** Ask for a tour of neighboring Château Fonroque (biodynamic).

#### 💶 Estimated Extras
*   **Dinner Menu:** ~€70–€105 per person (without wine).
*   **Spa Treatments:** Massages start from ~€75 (30 min) to €140 (1 hour).
*   **Electric Bike Rental:** ~€40 per day per person.
*   **Saint-Émilion "Little Train" Tour:** ~€15 per adult (great for a quick overview).
*   **Winery Tour (e.g., Fonroque):** ~€25 per person.

### 💰 Cost Comparison: Vineyard vs. City
Is it cheaper to stay in the city? **Yes, significantly.**

**1. The "Grand Barrail" Experience (Vineyard Stay)**
*   **Hotel:** ~$400+/night
*   **Transfers:** ~€150–€200 roundtrip (Taxi/Uber from Bordeaux Station is ~€80-100 each way).
*   **Dining:** Hotel dining is pricier (~€200 for two).
*   **Total (1 Night):** **~$750–$800+**

**2. The Smart City Stay (Historic Center)**
*   **Hotel:** ~$200–$250/night (e.g., Hôtel de Tourny).
*   **Transfers:** ~€30 (Tram/Taxi from station is cheap).
*   **Day Trip to St-Émilion:** ~€30 roundtrip train tickets for two.
*   **Dining:** Huge range of options in Bordeaux city (€80–€100 for a great dinner).
*   **Total (1 Night):** **~$350–$450**

**Verdict:** Staying in the city saves you **~$400**, mostly on transfers and the room rate. You still get to visit Saint-Émilion easily by train the next day!

## 🤔 The Final Trade-Off: Bordeaux vs. Saint-Jean-de-Luz
*You asked: "Are we better off with an extra day in Bordeaux than St-Jean?"*

**The Case for 2 Nights Bordeaux (Cut St-Jean)**
*   **Pro:** You get a full, relaxed day for Saint-Émilion wineries. No "Half-Day Sprint."
*   **Pro:** You see more of Bordeaux city (which is grand and beautiful).
*   **Con:** You lose the French Basque Coast entirely. No quiet ocean sunset, no "cute village" feel. It becomes a City-heavy trip.

**The Case for 1 Night Saint-Jean-de-Luz (Keep as is)**
*   **Pro:** It is the most romantic stop on the trip. Quiet, ocean, seafood, ancient history.
*   **Pro:** It breaks up the journey from Spain to Loire.
*   **Con:** Your Bordeaux stay is short (1 night).

*   **My Verdict:** For a **honeymoon**, keep Saint-Jean-de-Luz. You will already see a big city (Paris) and wine country (Loire). You won't see a cute fishing village like this anywhere else.
- **Top Picks for a "Nice" Hotel:**
    - **[Le Boutique Hotel & Spa](https://hotelbordeauxcentre.com):** (Value/Location) **[SELECTED]** Right in the center with a lovely courtyard/pool. **Price:** $$–$$$ (~$250–$400)
    - **[Yndo Hotel](https://www.yndohotelbordeaux.fr/):** (Luxury/Design) **Amex FHR Member**. Very intimate (12 rooms), "crazy/chic" decor. Highly recommended for a unique vibe. **Price:** $$$ (~$300–$500)
    - **[Villas Foch](https://www.villasfoch.com):** (Wellness/Classic) 5-star with a huge spa. Very elegant and relaxing. **Price:** $$$ (~$300–$450)
    - **[InterContinental Bordeaux Le Grand Hotel](https://bordeaux.intercontinental.com/):** (Classic Grandeur) **Amex FHR Member**. The big "Palace" hotel opposite the Opera. Best if you want traditional luxury & rooftop drinks. **Price:** $$$$ ($450+)
- **Pros:** Walkable to dozens of restaurants, lively atmosphere, easy "landing", significantly cheaper logistics.

## 🏃‍♀️ The "One Night" Strategy (Can I visit a winery?)
*Arrival 4:00 PM on Day 1 means wineries are likely closed. Day 2 is your only chance.*

**Option 1: The "City & Chill" (Recommended)**
*   **Day 1 Evening:** Walk the **[Miroir d'Eau](#sights--activities)**, dinner at **[Le Petit Commerce](#dining--drinks)**.
*   **Day 2 Morning:** Visit **[La Cité du Vin](#sights--activities)** (world-class wine museum, open 10am, includes a glass of wine with view) OR explore the **Chartrons** antique district.
*   **Day 2 Afternoon:** Train to **Saint-Jean-de-Luz** (Direct TGV, ~2 hours).
*   *Verdict: Stress-free, great food, you still drink wine.*

**Option 2: The "Winery Sprint"**
*   **Day 1 Evening:** Dinner in Bordeaux.
*   **Day 2 Morning (8:30 AM - 1:30 PM):** Book a **Half-Day Saint-Émilion Tour**.
    *   Many operators (like Bordeaux Wine Trails) do a 9:00 AM–1:30 PM morning loop. You visit 1-2 châteaux + the village.
*   **Day 2 Afternoon:** Grab a sandwich and take the afternoon train to **Saint-Jean-de-Luz**.
*   *Verdict: Doable, but rushy. You must book the afternoon train.*
