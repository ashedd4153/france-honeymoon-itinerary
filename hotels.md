## 📝 Hotel Details

### 🍷 Bordeaux: Le Boutique Hotel & Spa
*   **Why:** Perfect location in the city center (Golden Triangle), lovely courtyard, small pool. A great "soft landing" for 1 night.
*   **Vibe:** Sophisticated, quiet, walkable.

### 🥘 San Sebastián: Hotel Villa Soro
*   **Why:** A renovated historic villa in the Gros neighborhood. It feels like a private home.
*   **Vibe:** Quiet luxury away from the noisy Old Town crowds. Garden setting.
*   **Alternative (Views):** **Lasala Plaza**. Right on the harbor in Old Town. Modern, incredible bay views, but busier.

### 🌊 Saint-Jean-de-Luz: Hôtel Parc Victoria
*   **Why:** The most romantic garden hotel in town. It feels like a 19th-century estate.
*   **Vibe:** Old-school Basque charm, 5-star service, pool.

### 🏰 Loire Valley: Le Manoir les Minimes
*   **Why:** Located *directly* under the Royal Château of Amboise. You can walk to dinner.
*   **Vibe:** Classic French manor, river views, very convenient.

### 👑 Versailles: Waldorf Astoria Trianon Palace
*   **Why:** It is *on* the grounds of the Palace. You walk out the back door into the Royal Gardens.
*   **Vibe:** Grand, opulent, incredible spa. It is a true "Palace" hotel experience.

### 🗼 Paris: La Fantaisie
*   **Why:** New, lush, garden-themed boutique hotel in the cool 9th Arr (South Pigalle).
*   **Vibe:** Vibrant, fun, great rooftop bar. It feels distinct from the "stuffy" luxury hotels.
