## ⚖️ Pacing Reality Check
*Is this too much travel?*
It involves **5 moves**, which is active for a honeymoon, but structurally sound because of the **"Anchors."**
*   **The Anchors:** You have a solid block of **4 Nights** (Paris) at the start and **3 Nights** (San Sebastián) at the end.
*   **The Connectors:** The stops in between (Versailles, Loire, Bordeaux, St-Jean) create a perfect North-to-South flow.
*   **Verdict:** This is a "Grand Tour" style honeymoon. It is perfect if you want variety (Food, Beach, Castles, City). It is **not** a "flop on the beach" honeymoon.

## 🕵️ Did You Miss Anything? (The "FOMO" Check)
*Are there other "Classic Stops" on your train line?*

1.  **Biarritz:** (15 mins from St-Jean).
    *   *Vibe:* Imperial glamour, surf, flashy casinos. "The Hamptons of France."
    *   *Verdict:* St-Jean is more romantic/authentic. Biarritz is for shopping and showing off. You aren't missing out by skipping it.
2.  **Bayonne:** (20 mins from St-Jean).
    *   *Vibe:* Historic riverside city. Famous for **Chocolate** and **Ham**.
    *   *Verdict:* Good for a rainy afternoon, but not a "must stay" over the beach.
3.  **Chartres:** (Between Loire and Paris).
    *   *Vibe:* World-famous Gothic Cathedral with incredible stained glass.
    *   *Logistics:* A bit tricky with luggage on the way to Versailles.
    *   *Verdict:* Skip. You are seeing Versailles and Notre Dame (Paris). You will have "Cathedral Fatigue."

**Conclusion:** Your route hits the *Best of Class* for each region. You didn't miss anything critical.
