# Loire Valley
**2 Nights · July 25–27**

## Overview

The Loire Valley is France's garden, famous for its stunning Renaissance châteaux and exceptional wines. A perfect overnight stop between Versailles and Bordeaux.

## 🏰 Pacing Decision: 1 Night vs. 2 Nights?
*You asked to let the activities drive the time. Here is the trade-off:*

### The "Sprint" (1 Night)
*   **Time:** Arrive Sunday afternoon, Depart Monday afternoon.
*   **What you get:**
    *   **1 Château:** Probably **Chenonceau** (the most romantic/iconic) on Sunday afternoon.
    *   **Dinner:** Nice meal in Amboise.
    *   **Morning:** Quick coffee, maybe a view of Amboise castle from outside, then train to Versailles.
*   **Missing:** Wine tasting, Chambord, biking, relaxing.

### The "Savour" (2 Nights) - *Recommended*
*   **Time:** Arrive Saturday afternoon, Depart Monday morning.
*   **What you get:**
    *   **Day 1:** Arrival & Sunset dinner in Amboise.
    *   **Day 2 (The Big Day):**
        *   **Morning:** **Château de Chenonceau** (beat the crowds).
        *   **Lunch:** Picnic or bistro in the gardens.
        *   **Afternoon:** **Wine Tasting** in Vouvray (Sparkling/White) OR **Chambord** (The giant one).
        *   **Activity:** Rent e-bikes and ride along the river to the château (very flat/easy).
*   **Verdict:** 2 Nights allows you to actually *do* something (Wine + 2 Castles) rather than just *see* one thing.

## Where to Stay

Consider staying near **Tours** or **Amboise** for easy TGV access:
- Amboise offers a more intimate, château-village feel
- Tours is larger with more dining options and direct TGV connections

## 🍷 Wine & Activities Guide

### 1. The Châteaux (Pick 2)
*   **Chenonceau ("The Ladies' Castle"):** *Must-do.* Spans the river. Romantic, elegant gardens. Best for couples.
*   **Chambord:** *The Giant.* Massive, royal, double-helix staircase (Da Vinci). Impressive scale.
*   **Amboise:** *The Convenient One.* Right in town, great views, Da Vinci's grave.

### 2. The Wine (Pick 1 Region)
*   **Vouvray (White/Sparkling):** Just across the river from Amboise. Famous for Chenin Blanc (from dry to sweet). Visit troglodyte (cave) cellars.
*   **Chinon (Red):** Bold Cabernet Francs. A bit further west, medieval castle vibe.
