# Train Planning & "Hassle" Analysis
*Is it too much travel? Let's look at the reality.*

## 🚦 The "Friction" Scale
*   **Leg 1 (Arrival):** CDG → Bordeaux (2h). **Necessary.** You have to get south anyway.
*   **Leg 2 (Border):** Bordeaux → San Sebastián (2.5h). **Easy.** Direct high-speed or 1 easy change.
*   **Leg 3 (The "Fake" Travel Day):** San Sebastián → St-Jean-de-Luz (30 mins). **Zero Hassle.** It's a taxi ride or a commuter train. Don't count this as a "travel day."
*   **Leg 4 (The Big One):** St-Jean-de-Luz → Loire Valley (4.5h). **Hard.** This is your one long haul.
*   **Leg 5 & 6 (The Commute):** Loire → Versailles → Paris. **Easy.** Short hops (<1.5h) on standard commuter lines.

**Verdict:** You really only have **1 Long Travel Day** relative to your location (Leg 4). The rest are short hops that feel like day trips.
