### 🆚 Why are these cheaper than the "Palaces"?

You're seeing **$500–700** vs. **$1,500–2,000+**. Here is the objective breakdown of why the price gap exists.

#### ✅ "Good" Reasons (Smart Savings)
- **Brand Heritage Tax:** You aren't paying for a name like "Ritz" or "Plaza Athénée." High-end Marriott/Dorchester hotels charge for the legacy.
- **Modern Hardware:** Properties like **La Fantaisie** (2023) and **Sax LXR** are newer. You get USB-C ports and modern HVAC instead of "classic" (old) French plumbing and heavy drapes.
- **Service Scale:** A Palace has a ~1:3 staff-to-guest ratio. These FHR hotels are closer to 1:1. You still get a concierge and turndown service, but not a dedicated butler for your floor.
- **Marketing Strategy:** Newer hotels often use AMEX FHR to "buy" visibility, offering better rates to build a reputation.

#### ⚠️ "Bad" Reasons (The Trade-offs)
- **Location Prestige:** Palaces are on **Avenue Montaigne** or **Place Vendôme**. The FHR options are in great (often cooler) neighborhoods like **SoPi (9th)** or the **Bas Marais**, but they lack the "Golden Triangle" zip code.
- **Room Scale:** In a Palace, a "Standard" room is often 400+ sq ft. In these FHR hotels, a Standard is "Paris-sized" (250–300 sq ft). You have to book a Junior Suite to match Palace space.
- **Legacy "Vibe":** You won't find the gilding, crystal chandeliers, or "Napoleon stayed here" history. These are **lifestyle luxury**, not **institutional luxury**.

**The Verdict:** For a honeymoon, these FHR options are the **"Value Splurge."** You get the $600 credit and $100 perks, and you're paying for the *actual* room rather than the history of the building.
