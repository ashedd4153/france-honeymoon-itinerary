# Versailles

**1 Night · July 27**

## Overview

Versailles is more than just a palace; it's a world-class historical site with a charming, walkable town. Staying overnight allows you to experience the Gardens in the late afternoon and the Palace first thing in the morning before the day-trippers arrive from Paris.

## Why Visit

- **The Palace (Château)**: The Hall of Mirrors, King's Grand Apartments, and Royal Chapel are masterpieces of French Baroque architecture.
- **The Gardens**: André Le Nôtre's legendary French formal gardens, featuring fountains, sculptures, and the Grand Canal.
- **The Estate of Trianon**: A more intimate look at royal life, including the Grand Trianon and Marie Antoinette's Hamlet (Le Hameau de la Reine).
- **The Town**: Walkable streets, high-quality local restaurants, and the Marché Notre-Dame for local treats.

## Where to Stay

Versailles offers excellent value compared to central Paris:

- **Hôtel le Louis Versailles Château - MGallery**: Upscale, literal steps from the palace.
- **Hôtel du Jeu de Paume**: Historic boutique hotel in a former royal tennis court building.
- **Hôtel la Résidence du Berry**: Mid-range option with classic French character.

## Getting There & Away

- **From Loire Valley (Tours)**: TGV to Paris Montparnasse, then Transilien Line N directly to Versailles Chantiers (~1.5 hours total).
- **To Paris**: RER C, Transilien Line N (to Montparnasse), or Line L (to Saint-Lazare) take 30–45 minutes.

## Pro Tips

- **Book Tickets Early**: Entry is timed; book the first slot (9:00 AM) to avoid the heaviest crowds.
- **The Gardens are Free**: Most days (except Musical Fountains days), the gardens are free to enter and stay open later than the palace.
- **Walk the Town**: Have dinner in the *Quartier Saint-Louis* or *Quartier Notre-Dame*.
