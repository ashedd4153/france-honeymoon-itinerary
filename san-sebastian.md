### ⚠️ A Note on Crowds (The Summer Reality)
**YES, these places will be mobbed in July/August.** 
Expect "shoulder-to-shoulder" crowds, "fighting" to order at the bar, and lines out the door.
*   **The Strategy:**
    *   **Go Early:** Start your evening crawl at **6:30 PM - 7:00 PM** (before the 8:30 PM local rush).
    *   **Lunch is Easier:** The 12:30 PM - 1:00 PM window is often slightly calmer than the night shift.
    *   **Divide & Conquer:** If you are a group of 2, one person finds a spot to stand, the other fights to the bar to order.

### Must-Visit Pintxos Bars & Crowd Warnings
*   **[Bar Nestor](https://www.instagram.com/barnestor1980/):** 
    *   *The Famous Tortilla:* They only make **two** per day (1 PM and 8 PM). You **must** go 1 hour early (12 PM or 7 PM) to put your name on a list to get a slice. It is a "cult" experience.
    *   *The Steak (Txuleta):* You can order this anytime, but bring patience. Tiny spot, always packed.
*   **[Ganbara](https://www.ganbarajatetxea.com/en/):** 
    *   *The Dish:* Wild mushrooms (setas) with egg yolk.
    *   *Crowd Factor:* **High.** Often a line out the door just to get in.
*   **[Borda Berri](https://virtualtxoko.com/project/borda-berri/):** 
    *   *The Vibe:* "Chock-a-block." No food on the bar (order from menu).
    *   *The Dish:* Veal cheeks (Carrillera) and Idiazabal Risotto.
*   **La Cuchara de San Telmo:** 
    *   *Crowd Factor:* Nearly always a queue.
    *   *The Dish:* Suckling pig or Foie Gras.
*   **[La Viña](https://lavinarestaurante.com/):** 
    *   *The Cheesecake:* There is a specific line just for cheesecake takeout. It moves fast, but it is long.

### 🧘 The "No-Stress" Alternatives (Locals' Favorites)
*Don't want to fight for your food? Go here.*
*   **Bar Zabaleta (Gros):** *The Alternative Tortilla.* widely considered equal to (or better than) Nestor's, and you don't have to queue for an hour.
*   **Bar Bergara (Gros):** A classic. Famous for the "Txalupa" (prawn & mushroom boat). Spacious and relaxed.
*   **Bar Antonio (Centro):** Excellent food, famous for their Ravioli of prawn and mushroom. A favorite of chefs.

## 🗺 Activities
## 🐟 Spotlight: The Getaria Day Trip
*Why is this the "Game Changer" for Day 3?*

Getaria is a tiny, stunning medieval fishing village about 30 mins west of San Sebastián. It is famous for three things:
1.  **Grilled Fish:** It is the world capital of grilling whole fish over charcoal. You will smell the smoke the moment you arrive.
    *   **The Legend:** **[Elkano](https://www.restauranteelkano.com/)** (1 Michelin Star). Anthony Bourdain called it his "final meal." You must book months in advance. **Cost:** Expect ~€100–€150/person (Turbot is priced by kg, usually ~€90–€100 to share).
    *   **The Alternative:** **[Kaia Kaipe](http://www.kaia-kaipe.com/)**. Right next door, amazing cellar, slightly easier to book. **Cost:** ~€70–€100/person.
2.  **Fashion:** It is the birthplace of **Cristóbal Balenciaga**. There is a world-class **[Balenciaga Museum](https://www.cristobalbalenciagamuseoa.com/en/)** dedicated to him at the top of the village.
3.  **Txakoli Wine:** The village is surrounded by vineyards sloping into the sea. You can walk from the town center right into a vineyard (e.g., **Gaintza**) for a tasting.

*Logistics: Take the **Lurraldebus** (UK09/UK10/UK11) from San Sebastián center. It's cheap, easy, and scenic.*

### 🏨 Staying in Getaria?
*   **Yes, people do.** It is incredibly romantic and quiet at night.
*   **Top Pick:** **[Hotel Iturregi](https://www.hoteliturregi.com/en/)**. A stunning luxury boutique hotel set amongst the vineyards *above* the town. Very premium, very peaceful.
*   **Old Town Pick:** **[Saiaz Getaria Hotela](https://www.saiazgetaria.com/en/)**. Built into the 15th-century city walls, overlooking the sea.
*   *Note:* If you stay here, you are committed to a quiet village evening (no nightlife).

## 🐴 Horseback Riding (For Experienced Riders)
*   **Recommendation:** **Basque Land by Horse** (Oiartzun Valley) or **Hípica Loreak**.
*   **The Experience:** Request a **Private Guide** for advanced riders.
    *   **Terrain:** Mountain trails with ocean views (Peñas de Aya).
    *   **Pace:** Opportunity to **trot and canter** on open tracks (unlike the nose-to-tail beginner options).
    *   **Vibe:** Athletic and scenic, not "romantic/slow."
*   **Time:** Allow a full morning (pickup ~9:00 AM).

## 🍷 Wine
- **Txakoli** – the local crisp white, poured dramatically
- Abundant at every pintxos bar
- Rioja reds available everywhere

## ✈️ Departure
- **Bilbao Airport (BIO):** ~1h by bus or car
- Optional: Stop in Bilbao to see the Guggenheim before flying
