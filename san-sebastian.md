**3 Nights · July 30 – August 2** (Thursday–Sunday)
[← Back to Itinerary](README.md)

## 🚆 Getting There
- **From Saint-Jean-de-Luz:** Short taxi (25 min) or Euskotren "Topo" (40 min)
- **Border:** You cross the river Bidasoa; usually seamless.

## 🏨 Where to Stay: Old Town vs. Gros
*The classic dilemma: Be in the mix (Old Town) or be where the surfers hang (Gros).*

## 🥘 Pacing Decision: 2 Nights vs. 3 Nights?
*Is 3 nights too much? Not if you like food.*

### The "Taste" (2 Nights)
*   **What you get:**
    *   **Day 1:** Arrival & Pintxos Crawl in Old Town.
    *   **Day 2:** La Concha beach walk + Monte Igueldo Funicular + Reserved Dinner (or more Pintxos).
*   **The Risk:** "Pintxos Fatigue." Be prepared to eat standing up two nights in a row. It can be intense.

### The "Feast" (3 Nights) - *Recommended*
*   **What you get:**
    *   **Day 1 & 2:** Same as above, but slower. Sit-down lunch on a terrace.
    *   **Day 3 (The Game Changer):** **GETARIA Day Trip.**
        *   Take the bus (~30 min) to this tiny grilled-fish village.
        *   Lunch at **Elkano** or **Kaia Kaipe** (world-famous grilled turbot).
        *   Visit the Balenciaga Museum.
*   **Verdict:** 3 Nights allows you to leave the city and see the "real" Basque coast (Getaria), plus eat at a calmer pace.

### Option B: Gros Neighborhood (The "Cool" Side)
*Across the river, younger vibe, near Zurriola surf beach. Best of all: it is calmer.*
*   **Is it far?** NO. It is a **5–10 minute walk** across the bridge to the Old Town. You are right there, but you can sleep without noise.
*   **Hotel Villa Soro:** (Boutique/Quiet) A renovated historic villa with a garden. Very chic and peaceful. Slightly further (15 min walk to Old Town), but true luxury. **Price:** $$–$$$ (~€200–€350)
*   **Hotel Arrizul Congress:** (Modern/Sleek) 4-star luxury. Reviews are outstanding (9.0+). Only a **5-minute walk** to the Old Town. **Price:** $$ (~€200–€300)
*   **Okako Hotel:** (Boutique/Artistic) quirky, high-design boutique hotel. Very highly rated. **Price:** $$ (~€150–€250)

### 💰 Smart Value Picks (Clean, Modern, Cheaper)
*   **Welcome Gros Hotel:** Modern, simple, very clean. 5 mins to Old Town. often **half the price** of Arrizul.
*   **Hotel Trueba:** Tiny but stylish rooms. Very friendly. Great location near the beach.

## 🍢 Food & Drink
*   **Pintxos Tours:** A great way to start if you're intimidated by the crowds.
    *   **Mimo San Sebastián:** The premium option. ~€175/person (includes impeccable wines).
    *   **Devour Tours:** Excellent storytelling and highly rated. ~$140/person.
    *   **DIY Strategy:** Check **Smitten Kitchen's (Deb Perelman)** "Favorites from Spain" for a curated list of spots if you prefer to go it alone.

### ⚠️ A Note on Crowds (The Summer Reality)
**YES, these places will be mobbed in July/August.** 
Expect "shoulder-to-shoulder" crowds, "fighting" to order at the bar, and lines out the door.
*   **The Strategy:**
    *   **Go Early:** Start your evening crawl at **6:30 PM - 7:00 PM** (before the 8:30 PM local rush).
    *   **Lunch is Easier:** The 12:30 PM - 1:00 PM window is often slightly calmer than the night shift.
    *   **Divide & Conquer:** If you are a group of 2, one person finds a spot to stand, the other fights to the bar to order.

### Must-Visit Pintxos Bars & Crowd Warnings
*   **Bar Nestor:** 
    *   *The Famous Tortilla:* They only make **two** per day (1 PM and 8 PM). You **must** go 1 hour early (12 PM or 7 PM) to put your name on a list to get a slice. It is a "cult" experience.
    *   *The Steak (Txuleta):* You can order this anytime, but bring patience. Tiny spot, always packed.
*   **Ganbara:** 
    *   *The Dish:* Wild mushrooms (setas) with egg yolk.
    *   *Crowd Factor:* **High.** Often a line out the door just to get in.
*   **Borda Berri:** 
    *   *The Vibe:* "Chock-a-block." No food on the bar (order from menu).
    *   *The Dish:* Veal cheeks (Carrillera) and Idiazabal Risotto.
*   **La Cuchara de San Telmo:** 
    *   *Crowd Factor:* Nearly always a queue.
    *   *The Dish:* Suckling pig or Foie Gras.
*   **La Viña:** 
    *   *The Cheesecake:* There is a specific line just for cheesecake takeout. It moves fast, but it is long.

### 🧘 The "No-Stress" Alternatives (Locals' Favorites)
*Don't want to fight for your food? Go here.*
*   **Bar Zabaleta (Gros):** *The Alternative Tortilla.* widely considered equal to (or better than) Nestor's, and you don't have to queue for an hour.
*   **Bar Bergara (Gros):** A classic. Famous for the "Txalupa" (prawn & mushroom boat). Spacious and relaxed.
*   **Bar Antonio (Centro):** Excellent food, famous for their Ravioli of prawn and mushroom. A favorite of chefs.
*   **Gure Txoko (Gros):** Famous for their fried potatoes and friendly vibe.

## 🗺 Activities
## 🐟 Spotlight: The Getaria Day Trip
*Why is this the "Game Changer" for Day 3?*

Getaria is a tiny, stunning medieval fishing village about 30 mins west of San Sebastián. It is famous for three things:
1.  **Grilled Fish:** It is the world capital of grilling whole fish over charcoal. You will smell the smoke the moment you arrive.
    *   **The Legend:** **Elkano** (1 Michelin Star). Anthony Bourdain called it his "final meal." You must book months in advance. **Cost:** Expect ~€100–€150/person (Turbot is priced by kg, usually ~€90–€100 to share).
    *   **The Alternative:** **Kaia Kaipe**. Right next door, amazing cellar, slightly easier to book. **Cost:** ~€70–€100/person.
2.  **Fashion:** It is the birthplace of **Cristóbal Balenciaga**. There is a world-class museum dedicated to him at the top of the village.
3.  **Txakoli Wine:** The village is surrounded by vineyards sloping into the sea. You can walk from the town center right into a vineyard (e.g., **Gaintza**) for a tasting.

*Logistics: Take the **Lurraldebus** (UK09/UK10/UK11) from San Sebastián center. It's cheap, easy, and scenic.*

### 🏨 Staying in Getaria?
*   **Yes, people do.** It is incredibly romantic and quiet at night.
*   **Top Pick:** **Hotel Iturregi**. A stunning luxury boutique hotel set amongst the vineyards *above* the town. Very premium, very peaceful.
*   **Old Town Pick:** **Saiaz Getaria Hotela**. Built into the 15th-century city walls, overlooking the sea.
*   *Note:* If you stay here, you are committed to a quiet village evening (no nightlife).

## 🐴 Horseback Riding (For Experienced Riders)
*   **Recommendation:** **Basque Land by Horse** (Oiartzun Valley) or **Hípica Loreak**.
*   **The Experience:** Request a **Private Guide** for advanced riders.
    *   **Terrain:** Mountain trails with ocean views (Peñas de Aya).
    *   **Pace:** Opportunity to **trot and canter** on open tracks (unlike the nose-to-tail beginner options).
    *   **Vibe:** Athletic and scenic, not "romantic/slow."
*   **Time:** Allow a full morning (pickup ~9:00 AM).
