    *   *Note:* Standard offer is 80k. Use an "Incognito" browser window to find higher targeted offers.

    *   Transfer to **Air France/KLM (Flying Blue)** or **Iberia** for Business Class redemption.

### 🧮 "Is it Worth It?" ROI Calculation (2025 Terms)
*Does the card pay for itself in Year 1?*

| Item | Cost / Loss | Value / Gain | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Annual Fee** | **-$895** | | *Increased from previous years.* |
| **Opportunity Cost** | **-$40** | | *Lost value of using this card (1x-5x pts) vs a flat 2% cash back card on $8k spend.* |
| **Hotel Credit** | | **+$600** | **Huge Upgrade:** Now $300 semi-annually. Use $300 for prepay booking before June, $300 for July/Aug booking. |
| **Resy Credit** | | **+$400** | $100/quarter at Resy restaurants. |
| **Uber Cash** | | **+$200** | $15/mo for rides or Eats. |
| **Lululemon Credit** | | **+$300** | $75/quarter (New benefit). |
| **Welcome Bonus** | | **+$2,625** | Est. value of 175k points @ 1.5 cents/point. |
| **NET TOTAL** | **-$935** | **+$4,125** | **PROFIT: ~$3,190** |

> **Verdict:** The fee is higher ($895), but the credits are significantly better. The **Hotel ($600) + Resy ($400)** credits alone cover the fee ($1,000 value vs $895 cost). The 175k points are essentially free money on top.

### ⏱️ Strategic Timing: Why Apply NOW (Dec/Jan)?
*Counter-intuitive: Don't wait for the trip.*

1.  **The "Double Dip" ($600 Total):** The Hotel Credit is semi-annual (Jan-Jun & Jul-Dec).
    *   **Apply Now:** Get $300 for Jan-Jun (use for Hotel A) **AND** $300 for Jul-Dec (use for Hotel B).
    *   **Wait until May/June:** You might miss the first window or be rushed to use it.
    *   **Wait until July:** You LOSE the first $300 entirely.
2.  **Dual Card Strategy (United + Amex):**
    *   **United Explorer:** Smart move for the flights. You get free checked bags and priority boarding (saving ~$160).
    *   **Amex Platinum:** Use for Hotels (FHR) + Dining + Daily Life.
3.  **The New Spend Math (Hitting the $8k):**
    *   *Challenge:* Without the ~$3k flight cost, the Amex $8k target is harder.
    *   **Target:** ~$1,333 / month for 6 months.
    *   *Plan:* Use Amex for all hotel deposits (~$2k) + groceries/dining.
    *   *Warning:* If you can't hit $1,333/mo naturally, postpone the Amex or prepay other bills.

## 💡 "Savings" Levers
*How to reduce costs if needed:*
1.  **Cut Paris Hotel:** Stay in a standard 4-star ($350/night) instead of FHR ($600). *Savings: ~$1,000.*
2.  **Self-Guide:** Skip the Private Horse Guide or Guided Food Tours. *Savings: ~$500.*
3.  **Dining:** Do picnic lunches (baguette/cheese) instead of sit-down. *Savings: ~$400.*
