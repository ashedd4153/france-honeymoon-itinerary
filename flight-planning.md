## Best Return Options from Annecy

**Primary Recommendation:**  
Take a bus or train from Annecy to **Geneva Airport (GVA)**, then fly to the U.S. via a one-stop or direct flight.

- Bus Annecy → Geneva Airport: ~1h 15m, €8–11
- Flights from GVA to U.S.: one-stop options available to major cities (e.g., New York, Chicago)

**Alternative:**  
Travel from Annecy to **Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport (LYS)** (~1.5 hours). Fewer international options but a solid backup.

**Not Recommended:**  
Returning to Paris (CDG) from Annecy to fly out. This adds 4–7 hours of extra travel and complexity unless:
- CDG flights are significantly cheaper
- You’re extending your trip in Paris
- You have a nonstop U.S. flight unavailable from GVA/LYS
